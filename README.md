# Developing a performant density plot using CanvasJS

The project demonstrates a react component that calculates and displays an estimated probability density curve for a set of scalar random variables.  The project comprises test data generators for normally-, uniformly-, and poisson-distributed data, and a kernel density estimator using a gaussian kernel with fixed scale.  A simple display component presents graphs of the random data and its estimated density.

This project uses CanvasJS for plotting. A license from CanvasJS is required.  See: https://canvasjs.com/license/
