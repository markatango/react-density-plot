# Developing a performant density plot using CanvasJS

The project demonstrates a react component that calculates and displays an estimated probability density curve for a set of scalar random variables.  The project comprises test data generators for normally- and uniformly-distributed data, and a kernel density estimator using a gaussian kernel, a simple display component that presents graphs of the random data and the estimated density.

This project uses CanvasJS for plotting. A license form CanvasJS is required.  See: https://canvasjs.com/license/
